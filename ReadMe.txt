The website I built and which I submit is a website for creating activities in the field of paintball.
About Me:
For the past two years I have been working as an instructor of the paintball game, every day I get to guide a large number of groups of all ages and 
of all types and I noticed that my boss does not have a website
which allows him to see the upcoming activities as well as those that have already taken place, unless he writes them in the diary.
Through this website, my boss, hereafter the manager, hereafter Admin
Admin (me) will be able to Register on the site and create cards of upcoming activities and those that have already taken place
The information will appear as a card, the administrator can edit and delete.
Every such action goes through the server and is ultimately saved in the Mongo database.
If you have just registered to the site and not as an administrator, you can watch a gallery of our activities 
and of course you can send me an email with the details of your activity and we will put it in the calendar and update accordingly.

Also, you can use this site even if you own another business, just register as a different manager, and add photos accordingly.

The application must be opened
(Only after you did
npm install- for install all the node-modules packages on both backend and fronted sides)
And through the terminal you have to tap
npm start in the backend folder
and
npm run start
in the folder
paintball-application\fronted\paintball-app>
and press y for the project to run on a different port
